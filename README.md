- 65% of the users were male, 25% were females, and 10% were unknown.
- There is a positive correlation between the age of the users and ride length. The younger riders tend to take longer rides
- Manhattan is showing to be the most popular location for ride origination.

- Most activity hours are from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.
- From 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM would be the window for bike maintenance due to low bike usage.

- Rides tend to be shorter than an hour in length with the mode being 5 minutes. The data is comparable for both male and females.

## Summary
From this analysis, most of the rides started in Manhattan, and were taken by male users during morning and evening rush hours.The majority of the users were subscribers. This may indicate that Citi Bike rentals are being used as an alternative to other forms of transportation by commuters.\
Additional analysis would be beneficial by:

- Looking at the trends across the entire year

- Incorporating weather patterns to see if temperature trends affect usage
